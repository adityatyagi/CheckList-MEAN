# CheckList-MEAN
A checklist (to-do) application developed on the MEAN stack.

The following application is a single page To-Do Checklist application developed using the MEAN stack.
M: MongoDB
E: Express
A: Angular
N: Node

To start the app:
1. In your CLI, type node server.js and hit Enter
2. In your browser, look for "localhost:3000"

Note: Though I have provided "node_modules" folder, but it is recommended not to upload this folder.
      If in future, you don't find the "node_modules" folder, in your CLI, run "npm install" before you start the server.
